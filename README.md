In the corporate world, ensemble models are utilized in order to increase the accuracy to avoid losses & increase the profitability in monetary terms. However, the development of these ensemble models which are developed to achieve the most optimized result is purely based on trial & error. The algorithms used in these ensemble models are selected on basis of the data & business problem at hand. There exists no relationship at present which can emphasize the impact of each algorithm on the overall model / other models. An equation or outcome which can identify the relation between multiple algorithms and the impact that they can have on the final result based on datasets can ease the development by reducing the span of training time taken by these models. In this paper, we intend to identify the relation between multiple algorithms in individual ensemble models along with the contribution of each algorithm to the overall accuracy.
